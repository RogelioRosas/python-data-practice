### Notebooks worked through the courses "Python for Data Science, AI & Development" and "Python for Data Science" of IBM in Coursera

## Python for Data Science, AI & Development
Status: Completed

Topics:
- Python basics
- Control flow
- Functions
- Intro to data handling

Notes:
Course completed after a long break from Python.
Goal was to regain fluency.

## Python for Data Science 
Status: Completed

Skills acquired: 
* Data cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data visualization
* Creation of simple models (LRE, MRE, Polynomial, Ridge)

The natural:
* Handling pandas dataframes for EDA as well as data visualization for data familiarization feels natural.
* Using seaborn and matplotlib functions to create regression, box, scatter plots, and bar plots feels natural but it can still improve.
* Creating models imported from sklearn, specially LRE, MRE, Pipelines, and Ridge models feels good.
* Using metrics as R^2 score and MSE feels intuitive. 

To improve: 
* I think I can still practice more with the whole EDA and creating models, as well as evaluating and comparing them to find the best.
  
The most interesting: 
* The predictions.
